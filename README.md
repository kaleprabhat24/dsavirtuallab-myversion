## 🧪 Explore the Lab

Join us in enhancing your understanding of essential algorithms and data structures through:

* 🧠 Interactive tutorials
* 📊 Visualization tools
* 🛠️ Hands-on coding practice

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

* Understand fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues
* Learn algorithms for searching and sorting
* Gain hands-on experience with algorithm design and implementation
* Analyze the efficiency and complexity of algorithms
* Apply concepts to real-world problem-solving

---

## 🖥️ Backend Info

The backend server is set up using **Node.js and Express**. It handles API requests and interacts with data logic components.

To run the **backend**:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The server will typically run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

---

## 🎨 Frontend Info

The frontend is built using **React** and communicates with the backend to provide an interactive user interface with algorithm visualizations.

* 📁 Directory: `/frontend`
* 🔧 Key Tech: React, JSX, CSS

## 🧰 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start` – Runs the app in development mode
* `npm test` – Launches the test runner
* `npm run build` – Builds the app for production
* `npm run eject` – Reveals configuration files (not reversible)

Refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more details.
