//                 <li>3.GPS navigation systems- Linked lists can be used to store and manage a list of locations and routes, allowing

//                 <li>4.Robotics- Linked lists can be used to implement control systems for robots, allowing them to navigate and

//                 <li>5.File Systems- File systems use linked lists to represent the hierarchical structure of directories, where each

            <h2>Real Life Applications of Breadth First Search (BFS)</h2>
            <p>Breadth First Search (BFS) is widely used in various real-life applications, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. **Social Networks** - BFS is used to find the shortest path between users, suggesting friends or connections based on mutual friends.</li><br />
                <li>2. **Web Crawlers** - Search engines utilize BFS to crawl the web, systematically visiting all the links on a page and adding them to their index.</li><br />
                <li>3. **Networking** - In computer networks, BFS helps in broadcasting packets to all nodes, ensuring that data reaches every device in a network efficiently.</li><br />
                <li>4. **GPS Navigation** - BFS is used in GPS systems to find the shortest route from one location to another, exploring all possible paths before selecting the optimal one.</li><br />
                <li>5. **Game Development** - In AI for games, BFS can be used to determine the best moves by exploring all possible game states before deciding on the next action.</li><br />
